# 3D-C-Renderer

I created this project quite a while ago, it's a very simple 3D renderer made with SDL2.
I made a few custom stuff for it, for example the camera handling and line rendering and even the mesh types are all custom.
Unfortunately unless you understand what I did (which even I barely do lmfao) you won't be able to do much with the code, and even if you do currently it's a one off thing that can't be used like a game engine of sorts, it just is as is, by itself, of itself and for itself, but itself is retarded.
